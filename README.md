# Alexa Weather Helper
This is the Alexa Skill that I build to help me get weather information and decide what to wear each morning.

# Motivation
This project is mainly to understand how Amazon support developer and how to create a skill for Alexa. Second thing is that
I want to customize my weather app instead of using default one provided with Alexa

# Usage
You can just download this project. Change the config.js file as you want. This project uses forecast.io api to parse weather 
information. 

This skill can help you get current weather information, get weather forecast for the next week and suggest what to wear today.

You can say something like:
```
Get current weather information
What is the weather like

Get weather forecast for tomorrow
Get weather forecast for Monday

What should I wear today
```

Feel free to try and notify me if there's any issue!
